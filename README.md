## Overview

This branch contains the rewritten code for Thaumcraft:Re based on the lagacy branch, designed for any newer Minecraft version. This codebase will serve as my unofficial rewrite of the mod, which will support both Forge/NeoForge and Fabric/Quilt loader frameworks. By leveraging Architectury, an API for developing multi-loader mods, I aim to simplify multi-loader support and streamline the mod development process while retaining all original functionalities.

Special thanks to **Azanor**, the original developer of Thaumcraft, for creating such an incredible mod.

In this rewrite, I will be replacing Baubles (a mod API that adds 7 bauble slots to the player's inventory) with Curios for Forge and Trinkets for Fabric, ensuring compatibility and enhancing the mod's functionality.

**The legacy branch will remain unchanged.**

Please note that **an official successor to Thaumcraft will be coming soon from CoFH**. This project is only a port of the existing code.
